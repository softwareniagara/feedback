As a **grassroots** organization, we want to be as **transparent** as possible,
so we'll be holding our discussions in **public** on GitHub.  
This means you can easily see what we're doing and jump in at any time if you have a question or want to contribute.

### :point_right: Start a discussion :point_left:

Asking a question or starting a new discussion is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/softwareniagara/feedback/issues/new)
on this project.

If you have any suggestions or questions about Software Niagara, our events, our culture, work practices, technical aspects,
or just something in general, send 'em this way!

We'll try to answer as soon as we can get to it. Once one of us answers, we may close the
issue just so we know it's covered, but don't worry â€“ if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### :point_right: Read some past discussions :point_left:

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/softwareniagara/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
to browse discussions we've had in the past.  
We're trying to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

or directly to [any of our team members](http://softwareniagara.com/about/#team).
If the information isn't sensitive, we prefer that you
[create a new issue](https://github.com/softwareniagara/feedback/issues/new) instead of emailing us.
